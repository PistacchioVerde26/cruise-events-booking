# Cruise events booking platform

This project was developed as the final project for the exam of the 300 hours Software Developer course at the Assocam Scuola Camerana of Turin in 2018.

The idea was to develop a platform for a cruise ship were people could book events occurring during the trip. A total of 9h were given between first analysis, devlopment and consumptive analys.
To develop the front end of this web app i used Angular 6 with NgRx for the state managment and a simple ASP.NET WebApi 2.0 for the backend, implementing a sort of DAO pattern for the DB managment.

Sadly, since the time was not that much, the app altough does what was required is not very user friendly and features rich. 
I might add some functionalities and polish it in the future, just for fun.
